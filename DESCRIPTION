Description: Gene‐based association tests to model count data with excessive zeros and rare variants using zero-inflated Poisson/zero-inflated negative Binomial regression framework. This method was originally described by Fan, Sun, and Li in Genetic Epidemiology 46(1):73-86 <doi:10.1002/gepi.22438>.
